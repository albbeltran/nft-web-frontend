All these aspirations are directed toward enabling man's life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom” (Einstein)<br></br>If there is a single individual in which the spirit of multinationalism manifests itself, it would be Albert Einstein. He shared his knowledge of physics, not just as a science, but as an art.

Throughout his life, Mandela was a controversial figure who faced torrents of criticism. Yet today, we are able to look back at his achievements and take them for granted, without truly recognizing his sheer bravery and perseverance in the face of injustice.

There is a certain je ne sais quoi to the nostalgia and sentiment of Miyazaki’s works— and yet somehow, it resonates with audiences of different generations equally.
