                    Our collection presents influential individuals such as Aristotle, Einstein, Da Vinci,
                    and Jeanne Dâ€™Arc amongst many other remarkable personalities. These extraordinary characters

                    of elevating human consciousness.

                    We at Des Arts recognize these individuals as the embodiment of Art: we do not categorize art
                    and we do not constrain the Artist.
